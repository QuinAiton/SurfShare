# SurfShare

SurfShare is a personal full stack web application built with Node, Express, mongoDB and ejs that looks to fill the gap and offer a full surf community environment for the Victoria BC area. This project was inspired by my love for surfing and looks to bring the surf community togather by offering many features that I see missing in todays sites. THIS IS A PERSONAL SITE that I hope to bring to my fellow surfers in the near future and is my way of giving back to the sport that has given me so much.
